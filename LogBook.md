|     Empathy           |     How   can we design the tank such that it can produce a good quality HFO so that   the HFO does not breakdown often                                                                                                 |
|     Discover          |     We   discover how the tank can be modeled and built according to the size as well   as the relevant information needed, using the engineering calculation   spreadsheet we explore the set of data given.           |
|     Ideate            |     We   went online to search for the HFO and tank plate, settling tank and from   there we take a look at all the picture related and filter out which one is   best for us to use it as an inspiration to create.    |
|     Create            |     After   we get a rough idea of how we want to create we write out all the ideas we   have in our mind and we start to create using the F360 model to get a rough   idea of how our final project will be.           |
|     Validate          |     We   test our prototype to see if it can work and what improvements can be made as   well as what are some parts we can work on.                                                                                    |
|     Realise           |     After   testing the prototype, we can gather all the results as well as we can make a   conclusion and improvement to be made so that the next design can be a better   and improved version.                       |

### Problem Statement 
How might we design a HFO settling tank of 30m3 to store 20 Tonnes of Heavy Fuel Oil for a cargo ship safely and meeting IMO requirements. To meet the requirements, this tank will be designed according to IMO standard and classification society and is equipped to meet the contract specification and built within shipyard schedule and budget.
